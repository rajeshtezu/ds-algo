# Priority Queue

- A data structure where each element has a priority.
- Element with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.
- While inserting an element in `Heap`, we compare priority of elements instead of value.

## Time Complexity

Insertion - O(log(n))
Removal - O(log(n))
Search - O(n)

## Code Samples
