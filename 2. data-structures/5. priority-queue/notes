Priority Queue
--------------
A data structure where each element has a priority. 
Element with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

While inserting an element in Heap, we compare priority of elements instead of value.

---------------------------

Insertion - O(log(n))
Removal - O(log(n))
Search - O(n)
