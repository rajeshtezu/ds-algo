# Graph

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

In short a graph is `Nodes + connection`.

## Uses

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- Recommendations
- EVERYWHERE!

## Terms and types of graphs

- Vertex : a node
- Edge : connection between nodes
- Weighted/Unweighted : values assigned to distances between vertices
- Directed/Undirected : direction assigned to distance between vertices
