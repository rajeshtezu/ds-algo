Graph: A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordred pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

    In short - Nodes + connection

Uses: 
    - Social Networks
    - Location / Mapping
    - Routing Algorithms
    - Visual Hierarchy
    - File System Optimizations
    - Recommendations
    - EVERYWHERE!

Terms and types of graphs:
    - Vertex : a node
    - Edge : connection between nodes
    - Weighted/Unweighted : values assigned to distances between vertices
    - Directed/Undirected : diretion assigned to distance between vertices
