Tree - A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship.

List - Linear
Tree - Non linear

=> A singly linked list -> sort of special case of tree.
=> In tree sibling can not point each other.


Terminology
-----------
Root     : The top node in tree.
Child    : A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
Parent   : The converse notion of child.
Siblings : A group of nodes with the same parent.
Leaf     : A node with no children.
Edge     : The connection between one node and another.

e.g. 
HTML Dom
Network routing
Abstract Syntax Tree
Artificial Intelligence
Folders in operating system
Computer file system

Binary Tree : Each node can have at most 2 children.

BST : Binary tree with items stored in sorted order.
  - Every parent node has at most 2 children.
  - Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent.
  - Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent.

=> Tree traversal:
Two ways:
  1. Breadth-first search (BFS) - same level 1st
  2. Depth-first search (DFS)
      - In-order
      - Pre-order
      - Post-order


1. BFS:

steps (Iteratively):
  - Create a queue (array) and a variable (array) to store the values of nodes visited
  - Place the root node in the queue
  - Loop through as long as there is anything in the queue
    - Dequeue a node from the queue and push the value of the node into the variable that stores the nodes
    - If there is a LEFT node on the node dequeued, add it to the queue
    - If there is a RIGHT node on the node dequeued, add it to the queue
  - Return the variable that stores the values


2.1 DFS - PreOrder (parent -> left -> right)
- First element is root.

  Steps (Recursively):
  - Create a variable (array) to store the values of nodes visited
  - Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
  - Write a helper function which accepts a node
    - Push the value of the node to the variable that store the values
    - If the node has a LEFT node, call the helper function with the LEFT node
    - If the node has a RIGHT node, call the helper function with the RIGHT node
  - Invoke the helper function with the current variable
  - Return the array of values

2.2 DFS - PostOrder (left -> right -> parent)
- Last element is root.

  Steps (Recursively)::
  - Create a variable to store the values of node visited
  - Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
  - Write a helper function which accepts a node
    - If the node has a LEFT property, call the helper function with the LEFT property
    - If the node has a RIGHT property, call the helper function with the RIGHT property
    - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - Invoke the helper function with current variable
  - Return the array of values

2.3 DFS - InOrder (left -> parent -> right)

Steps (Recursively):
- Same as before (pre, post order), but put the push in between left and right traversal.

------------------------------------------------

Use:

DFS - When tree is wider [Save space complexity]
BFS - When tree is deeper [Save space complexity]

DFS - InOrder            --> sorted.
DFS - PreOrder/PostOrder --> Can be used to actually store in DB or any other persistent storage.

- Using InOrder & Post/Pre-Order we can construct a unique tree.
