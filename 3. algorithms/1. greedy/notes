## Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.

## WHY IS IT USEFUL?

- GPS - finding fastest route
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
- Many other uses!

## The Approach

- Every time we look to visit a new node, we pick the node with the smallest known distance to visit first.
- Once we’ve moved to the node we’re going to visit, we look at each of its neighbors
- For each neighboring node, we calculate the distance by summing the total edges that lead to the node we’re checking from the starting node.
- If the new total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we store the new shorter distance for that node.

## Dijkstra's Pseudocode

- This function should accept a starting and ending vertex
- Create an object (we'll call it distances) and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of infinity, except for the starting vertex which should have a value of 0.
- After setting a value in the distances object, add each vertex with a priority of Infinity to the priority queue, except the starting vertex, which should have a priority of 0 because that's where we begin.
- Create another object called previous and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of null
- Start looping as long as there is anything in the priority queue
  - dequeue a vertex from the priority queue
  - If that vertex is the same as the ending vertex - we are done!
  - Otherwise loop through each value in the adjacency list at that vertex
    - Calculate the distance to that vertex from the starting vertex
    - if the distance is less than what is currently stored in our distances object
      - update the distances object with new lower distance
      - update the previous object to contain that vertex
      - enqueue the vertex with the total distance from the start node

Improving Dijkstra's

- Dijkstra's algorithm is greedy! That can cause problems!
- We can improve this algorithm by adding a heuristics (a best guess)
