HTML Dom
Network routing
Abstract Syntax Tree

Computer file system

Binary Tree : Each node can have at most 2 children.

BST  : Binary tree with items stored in sorted order.

  - Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent.
  - Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent.
